## Navigate the Website
When you initially open the webpage, you will see the following screenshot. The top left header 'mtchrrs.' is my creator tag, and the on the left side, the 'About', 'Projects' and 'Contact' links will take you to the corresponding sections of the application, as labelled and pictured below. 

Navigating is easy.

As this is a one page application, all you need to do is make your way down the page...
